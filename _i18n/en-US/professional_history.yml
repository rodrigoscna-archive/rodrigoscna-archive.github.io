  role: "Systems Analyst/Developer"
  description: |
    Acting as a software analyst/developer for web and mobile platforms through
    various technologies.

    I had the opportunity to work with systems analysis using mostly the UML as
    a standard methodology always developing new skills and characteristics
    necessary to understand and design a system that suits the customer needs.

    At the same time, I also got the change to work with software development in
    several different technologies, such as:

    - Android, iOS and Windows Phone native apps development each on it's own
    native language and technology;
    - Android and iOS hybrid apps development based on the PhoneGAP platform;
    - Web systems development using the RubyOnRails framework, as well as the
    integration amongst web platforms and mobile apps through WebServices and
    APIs;
    - Web systems development using a proprietary framework in PHP which I
    participated actively on the development;
    - Also got the chance to work with projects regarding C# and the Asp.NET
    platform, both MVC and WebForms;
    - Through most projects, also worked with front-end development using from
    basic HTML, CSS and JS, to complex AngularJS pages.
