    Acting as a software analyst/developer for web and mobile platforms through
    various technologies.

    I had the opportunity to work with systems analysis, using mostly the UML as
    a standard methodology, always developing new skills and characteristics
    necessary to understand and design systems that suits the customer needs.

    I also worked with software development using several different technologies
    and platforms, such as:

    - Android, iOS and Windows Phone apps development with it's own native
    language and technology as well as with the PhoneGAP hybrid platform;
    - Web systems development using the Ruby on Rails framework, as well as the
    integration amongst web platforms and mobile apps through Web Services and
    APIs;
    - Web systems development using a proprietary PHP framework which I actively
    participated in the design and development from the concept to it's
    implementation;
    - Also got the chance to work with the C# language and the Asp.NET platform,
    both MVC and WebForms;
    - Through most projects, also worked with front-end development using from
    basic HTML, CSS and JS, to complex AngularJS pages.

    Over the last years of my employment at Inovare, I worked as a projects
    manager. During that time, I gained more responsibilities in the company.

    Although I kept working with software analysis and development, I also
    became mainly responsible for managing the team and the customers
    expectations and demands.

    I worked managing the projects risks, costs and deadlines of all sorts of
    project types. From maintenance contracts to software restructuring and
    entirely new softwares.

    In my new position, I also was an important part of an organizational
    restructuring initiative with the goal of improving the following processes:
    - Hiring capable and talented people;
    - Projects cost estimation;
    - Tasks management;
    - Team management.
